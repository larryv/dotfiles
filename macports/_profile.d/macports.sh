# Move MacPorts directories to the beginning of PATH and MANPATH so its

# add the directories to PATH in this file, but any files sourced
# earlier could not find MacPorts' software.  Using /etc/paths.d and
# /etc/manpaths.d gets the directories into the paths sooner, but they
# are appended after the default entries.  (See the path_helper(8) man
# page for details.)

    # going to overwrite it anyway, so I don't have to unset it here.
