# This configuration assumes GnuPG 2.2.19 or later.
#
# Any and all rationales are naive.  I have no idea what I'm doing.

# The 2.2.4 defaults with some tweaks.
#   - Accept Camellia and Twofish, GnuPG's other 128-bit block ciphers.
#   - Accept RIPEMD-160 to discourage use of SHA-1, which is broken for
#     signatures [1].
#   - Disallow compression, which leaks information about message
#     contents [2][3][4].
